News Headlines on the Day The three year bloodbath in Ulster reached a new level of savagery when terrorists unleashed a-killer blitz of stunning ferocity. This city has not experienced such a day of death and destruction since the German blitz of 1941. With the callous lack of remorse now so typical of the Provos they audaciously accept responsibility for what was an operation clearly requiring considerable planning and manpower. Throughout the 32 counties Irish men and women should ponder how a virulent Nazi-style disregard for life can lodge In the hearts of our fellow countrymen; all the more virulent in that once again the Innocent have been the main sufferers. Hitler In his Berlin bunker decided that the German people were no longer worthy of him and deserved not to survive. Yesterday's <trigger id='trigger-61'>dead</trigger> and <trigger id='trigger-60'>injured</trigger> and testimony to something similarly rotten in our philosophy of life. Every Irishman and woman must stand appalled and ashamed at the horror of what was perpetuated In Belfast yesterday In the name of Irish unity. Belfast is rocked and racked by the most ferocious blitz yet mounted by the IRA. Not even the German <role id='role-62-Instrument'trigno='62'>bombs</role> could inflict more <trigger id='trigger-62'>devastation</trigger> on the <role id='role-62-Place'trigno='62'>capital</role> of Ulster in the last war. On this unforgettable day 26 bombs, borne by car and planted to take the greatest <trigger id='trigger-63'>toll of life</trigger>, <trigger id='trigger-64'>shattered</trigger> the bodies of men, women and <role id='role-64-Victim'trigno='64'>children</role> in a fiendish holocaust of murder and hate. The wanton <trigger id='trigger-68'>killing</trigger> of non-combatant men, women and <role id='role-68-Victim'trigno='68'>children</role>-the inevitable consequence of <trigger id='trigger-69'>exploding</trigger> so many bombs without adequate warning-is yet another cruel act which will not be forgotten. A wanton <trigger id='trigger-67'>attack</trigger> on innocent men, women and <role id='role-67-Target'trigno='67'>children</role> THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT WAS MADE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND, MR. WILLIAM WHITELAW, IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, 24 JULY 1972:-As the House will know, the City and <role id='role-70-Target'trigno='70'>people</role> of <role id='role-70-Place'trigno='70'>Belfast</role> suffered a murderous sequence of <trigger id='trigger-70'>explosions</trigger> last Friday. Most of the 27 <trigger id='trigger-95'>explosions</trigger> in Belfast that day occurred within a 3½ hour period in the afternoon-at a time when, and at places where high civilian casualties must have been expected and intended. No adequate warnings were given. Seven civilians and two <role id='role-66-Victim'trigno='66'>soldiers</role> were <trigger id='trigger-66'>killed</trigger> and at least 130 <role id='role-71-Victim'trigno='71'>civilians</role> <trigger id='trigger-71'>injured</trigger>-many gravely. I hardly need point out that all sections of the community are indiscriminately affected by these outrages. Of the <trigger id='trigger-65'>dead</trigger> <role id='role-65-Victim'trigno='65'>two</role> were Roman Catholics. Of the <role id='role-72-Victim'trigno='72'>130</role> <trigger id='trigger-72'>injured</trigger> at least 40 were Roman Catholics. 53 were men and boys, 77 women and children. I am sure the whole House will wish to join with me in expressing sympathy to the families of all those involved in this wanton <trigger id='trigger-73'>attack</trigger> on innocent men, women and <role id='role-73-Target'trigno='73'>children</role>. After the appallingly bloodthirsty and <trigger id='trigger-74'>criminal</trigger> events of last Friday, there cannot be any remaining shred of support for the men who perpetrate them. Even those sectors of Roman Catholic opinion throughout the world which have traditionally identified themselves with and perhaps given the benefit of the doubt to any group of men who claimed to speak for the Irish Republican movement can surely no longer continue to uphold the men who were responsible for Friday's horrible catalogue of <trigger id='trigger-75'>slaughter</trigger>. Supporters of the Republican movement in this country, in Northern Ireland, in the United States and elsewhere, will no doubt notice the revulsion in some circles in the Irish Republic. Since Parliament at the end of March entrusted the Government with complete responsibility for all administration in Northern Ireland, we have made the most patient and reasoned effort to secure the end of violence. No one can deny that Her Majesty's Government have now an absolutely unchallengeable right to ask this House, this country, and indeed the whole world for their support in an absolute determination to destroy the capacity of the IRA for further acts of inhumanity. They have degraded the human race, and it must now be clear to all that their sole object is to promote their aims by violence and by violence alone. DESTRUCTION In Oxford Street bus station where <trigger id='trigger-76'>death</trigger> came to six <role id='role-76-Victim'trigno='76'>people</role> and <role id='role-77-Victim'trigno='77'>scores</role> were <trigger id='trigger-77'>injured</trigger>. The <role id='role-78-Place'trigno='78'>station</role> was crowded when the <role id='role-78-ExplosiveDevice'trigno='78'>bomb</role> <trigger id='trigger-78'>exploded</trigger>. It was the worst of the afternoon's 19 murderous <trigger id='trigger-96'>bombings</trigger>. <trigger id='trigger-80'>DESTRUCTION</trigger> at <role id='role-80-Artifact'trigno='80'>Smithfield bus station</role>, scene of the first of the vicious series of <trigger id='trigger-79'>attacks</trigger> on innocent people. Mercifully the buses here seen ablaze had not started filling up with passengers. <trigger id='trigger-81'>DESTRUCTION</trigger> in <role id='role-81-Artifact'trigno='81'>York Road railway terminus</role> where the bomb was in an innocent-looking suitcase left on the platform. Letters to the Editor Funeral with no shouted commands but only sobs of four small children TO-DAY (Monday) I went to a funeral-that of one of"Bloody Friday's"victims. It wasn't one of those funerals we know so well in Belfast, with the uniformed men, the ceremonial shots, the shouted commands, the graveside oration. The only uniforms were the black and white vestments of the clergy. The only arms were those of Christ crucified on the Cross which led the Cortege. No shouted <trigger id='trigger-82'>commands</trigger>-only the sobbing of four small children. No graveside oration, only the tears in the eyes of a husband as final tribute. If there is power in the sobs of children and the tears of husbands and fathers, wives and mothers then the cause espoused by the terrorist is on the point of <trigger id='trigger-83'>death</trigger>: its followers now are but walking. dead, animated husks, soulless and mindless. rejected and disowned by any creature capable of pity and compassion. The earth which thudded on that coffin covered only a body, not the bestial deed which sent it there, an ever-pointing finger of condemnation to all involved-the terrorists who planned the <trigger id='trigger-84'>bombing</trigger> campaign, the terrorists who made the bombs, the terrorists who planted them: the politicians who wouldn't talk until all their demands were met and the politicians who talked too much and too often said the wrong thing; the leading churchmen, who merely mouthed pious attitudes. condemning violence in general but never aiming at specific deeds and organisations: The trade unionists who permitted discrimination to be the unwritten rule in our industrial life and the industrialists and businessmen who bowed to this evil on their premises; the neighbours, who were true neighbours and friends-until intimidation entered their street. To-day's victim had the dignity and honour of innocence and motherhood to take to her grave and Maker, and leaves her legacy of a peace-loving, and In the course of time, happy family. Her killers will face their Maker with her blood and many others on their hands and can only leave a. their legacy hatred, sorrow and despair. A FACE IN THE CROWD, Belfast 13. <trigger id='trigger-85'>DESTRUCTION</trigger> In <role id='role-85-Artifact'trigno='85'>Botanic Avenue</role> after a <role id='role-86-ExplosiveDevice'trigno='86'>bomb</role> <trigger id='trigger-86'>exploded</trigger> in a hi-jacked bread van parked outside the <role id='role-86-Place'trigno='86'>York Hotel</role>. Cars and <role id='role-87-Artifact'trigno='87'>houses</role> <trigger id='trigger-87'>suffered</trigger> in the blast and there were the inevitable casualties. <trigger id='trigger-88'>DESTRUCTION</trigger> at the busy <role id='role-88-Artifact'trigno='88'>Antrim Road</role>-Limeston Road corner. The wreckage in the forefront is all that was left of the stolen van in which the bomb had been planted. Women shoppers were among the casualties. <trigger id='trigger-89'>DESTRUCTION</trigger> at the shopping <role id='role-89-Artifact'trigno='89'>centre</role> on the Cavehill Road, where one of the last of the bombs <trigger id='trigger-90'>killed</trigger> three <role id='role-90-Victim'trigno='90'>people</role>, including a mother of seven and a boy of 14. REPORTS'Streets swept by terror'"Such warnings as were given were so vague and imprecise as to be almost useless; For much of the afternoon Belfast was reduced to near total chaos and panic. Girls and men wept openly, hugging each other for safety in the main streets as plumes of smoke rose around them and dull thuds echoed from wall to wall. It was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe As each <role id='role-91-ExplosiveDevice'trigno='91'>bomb</role> <trigger id='trigger-91'>exploded</trigger> there were cries of terror from people who thought they had found sanctuary but in fact were just as exposed as before. Report in the Guardian.'A day of horror and shame'Friday, July 21, 1972, was a day of horror and shame in this stricken city. Even hardened newsmen recoiled with shock from the scenes of carnage witnessed in Belfast as firemen lifted the mangled bodies where bombs <trigger id='trigger-92'>ripped through</trigger> <role id='role-92-Victim'trigno='92'>crowds</role> of unsuspecting men, women and children at bus depots and other locations. In all my years of journalism, which included the worst days of the wartime blitzes, I have never seen scenes so horrible in this city and one felt a deep feeling of anger and shame that such deeds were planned and carried out by fellow Irishmen. All Ireland has been shamed by the events of this terrible July afternoon in Belfast. Report in the Irish Independent, Dublin.'A deed of sick men'"The chief injury is not to the British Army, to the Establishment or to big business but to the plain people of Belfast and Ireland. Anyone who supports violence from any s i d e after yesterday's events is sick with the same affliction as those who did the deed."Can anyone now believe that anything worth while can be established by these methods? That the country of anyone's vision can live with more memories of this kind?""Irish Times", Dublin.'The cold-blooded, co-ordinated bomb outrages are a shocking <trigger id='trigger-93'>crime</trigger> against an already innocent population who have already suffered too much. These were brutal murders which will be totally condemned by every decent person in the United Kingdom.'Mr. Harold Wilson, Leader of the Opposition THE BOMBERS STRIKE-AND THIS IS SOME OF THE SUFFERING THEY LEFT Scenes of anguish in Oxford Street Bus Station where six <role id='role-94-Victim'trigno='94'>people</role> <trigger id='trigger-94'>died</trigger>-as pictured in the Daily Express"A black sin. . . that will never be erased"By the Editor of the Sunday Independent Dublin These are dark days for Ireland. We live in an age of cowardice, with the guilt spread evenly between the highest and the lowest in the land. We fostered the men who planned the murders of innocent men, women, boys and girls in Belfast on Friday. We fed these people with propaganda. We took advantage, when we could, of their exploits. And because we are not a morally courageous people, we never seriously tried to stop their terrible excesses. Those among us who could have acted to halt the course of tragedy preferred to do nothing. Those who could have spoken out, when words might have meant something, chose to hold their tongues. And the rest of us were content to let matters slide. Now all of us must pay the price for this neglect. There is a black sin on the face of Irish Republicanism today that will never be erased. Murder now lies at the feet of the Irish nation and there is no gain-saying that fact. We cannot change past, however much we regret its record. But if we wish to restore the honour of our people, now is the time to act. We must break the paralysis that leaves the good name of the Irish people in the hands of unscrupulous men. And we must find a way to make restitution for our failings. The gallantry of those who planted bombs in the middle of Belfast's shopping areas on Friday (and then ran like hell) will be sanctified by the almighty god of Irish republicanism and reverently embalmed-in what we are pleased to call our national heritage. We won't have a ballad to commemorate the butchered fragments of a woman we saw on the telly being shovelled up by a fireman. Who said Dan Breen is dead? His spirit is alive and well and looking forward to a cosy corner in whatever parliamentary system we are going to have for the next 50 years. Is nobody going to shout stop!
